## Introduction
Car prices are influenced by many factors such as age, brand, condition, and mileage. The aim of this project is to use machine learning algorithms to build a model that can predict car prices accurately. This analysis is done using Python and various data analysis and machine learning libraries.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Load the dataset and perform data cleaning.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the data to uncover patterns, correlations, and distributions of features.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Modify or create new features to improve model performance.
4. **Model Selection and Training**: Select machine learning algorithms, train the models, and evaluate performance.
5. **Conclusion and Future Work**: Summarize the findings and discuss potential improvements.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about various cars, including:

- Car brand and model
- Manufacturing year
- Mileage
- Engine size
- Fuel type
- Transmission type
- Price (target variable)
